# social_cues_migration
This repository contains the code and data for Oestreich et al. (in prep): "The influence of social cues on timing of animal migrations". 

This project interrogates the roles of social cues in the timing of animal migrations. To investigate the role of social cues, we: (1) employ a systematic review to identify published case studies documenting the influence of social cues on timing of animal migrations; and (2) introduce an analytical framework to evaluate these case studies and a path forward for advancing this field of study. The case studies included in this analysis, search terms used to systematically identify case studies, and the code used to analyze and visualize trends in these case studies are included here.

data: contains a table of all identified case studies and associated metadata
scripts: contains all code used to analyze trends in the identified case studies
outputs: figures generated by the above scripts
search_terms.txt: explanation of the literature search strategy used to identify case studies
