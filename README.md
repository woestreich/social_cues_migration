# social_cues_migration
This repository contains the code and data for a project interrogating the roles of social cues in the timing of animal migrations. To investigate the role of social cues, we: (1) employ a systematic review to identify published case studies documenting the influence of social cues on timing of animal migrations; and (2) introduce an analytical framework to evaluate these case studies and a path forward for advancing this field of study. The case studies included in this analysis, as well as the code used to analyze and visualize trends in these case studies, are included here.
