This repository contains the code and data for "The influence of social cues on timing of animal migrations". Co-authors include William K. Oestreich, Kanoe M. Aiu, Larry B. Crowder, Megan F. McKenna, Andrew M. Berdahl, and Briana Abrahms.

This project interrogates the roles of social cues in the timing of animal migrations. To investigate the role of social cues, we: (1) introduce a conceptual framework to evaluate the influence of social cues on migration timing across scales; and (2) apply this framework to case studies (identified via systematic review) documenting the influence of social cues on timing of animal migrations. The case studies included in this analysis, search terms used to systematically identify case studies, the code used to analyze and visualize trends in these case studies, and PRISMA documentation for the systematic review are included here.

data: contains a table of all identified case studies and associated metadata

scripts: contains code used to analyze trends in the identified case studies

outputs: figures generated by the above scripts

search_terms.txt: explanation of the literature search strategy used to identify case studies
