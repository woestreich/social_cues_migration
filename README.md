# social_cues_migration
This repository contains the code and data for a project interrogating the roles of social cues in the timing of animal migrations. To investigate the role of social cues, we employ a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. The case studies included in this analysis, as well as the code used to analyze and visualize trends in these case studies, are included here. 

This project is a collaboration between Kanoe Aiu, Larry Crowder, and Will Oestreich at Stanford University.
